## Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase for authentication, storage, and database functionalities. Follow these steps to set up Firebase for your project:

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Click "Add Project" and follow the setup wizard
   - Give your project a name (e.g., "Collab App")
   - Enable Google Analytics if desired
   - Create the project

2. **Configure FlutterFire**:
   - Install Firebase CLI if not already installed:
     ```bash
     npm install -g firebase-tools
     ```
   - Login to Firebase:
     ```bash
     firebase login
     ```
   - Install FlutterFire CLI:
     ```bash
     dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
     ```
   - Run the FlutterFire configuration command in your project directory:
     ```bash
     flutterfire configure --project=your-firebase-project-id
     ```
   - Select the platforms you want to support (iOS, Android, Web, etc.)
   - This will generate a `firebase_options.dart` file which will replace the placeholder file

3. **Enable Authentication**:
   - In the Firebase Console, go to "Authentication" â†’ "Sign-in method"
   - Enable "Phone" as a sign-in provider
   - Set up other providers if needed

4. **Set up Firestore Database**:
   - Go to "Firestore Database" in the Firebase Console
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in production mode" or "Start in test mode" (for development)
   - Select a location for your database
   - Create a "users" collection for storing user profiles

5. **Set up Storage (if needed)**:
   - Go to "Storage" in the Firebase Console
   - Follow the setup wizard
   - Create storage rules for your app's needs

6. **Update iOS and Android configurations**:
   - For iOS: Update `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include necessary permissions
   - For Android: Ensure the minimum SDK version in `android/app/build.gradle` is set to 21 or higher

With these steps completed, your app should be properly connected to Firebase services.
